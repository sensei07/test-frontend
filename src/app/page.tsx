			Hello!
			This is my test task done with Next.js + Nest.js, TanStack Query
			<br/>
			<br/>
			I just experimented with Next.js and decided to make it this way, since at the same time I have another test task only on React, only the frontend part, and I would also like to share it, since it is quite standard and there is no confederation information.
			There I use a lot of different tools on the Front-end part, such as: React, TypeScript, ReduxToolkit, axios, scss, stylelint, eslint, React Testing Library, Jest, Storybook
		</p>
